Portfolio Repository.

Contained within this repository, is the source code of my portfolio.

Presently, the website is under construction. To gain some insight into my front-end skill set however, the project has been uploaded to GitHub for potential employers to clone or download. The repo will be updated as further work is completed on the site, with a live demo to be hosted here.
